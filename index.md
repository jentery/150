# Unlearning the Internet (DHum 150, Spring 2019 @ UVic)
Jentery Sayers 

**DRAFT** (notes for course development)

Intended audience: first-year undergraduates (all disciplines) at UVic

Class size: ~110 (with three TAs)

Emphasis on media praxis: not just digital re-presentation, but critical media-making 

Not a "calling bullshit course": beyond "gotcha!" to instead stress engagement and change 

## Prompts for Students (one per week)

Students will be prompted to perform the following exercises, each of which will correspond with a myth or popular assumption about technologies and media. Myths and assumptions will be grounded in media histories (18th c. to present) and contemporary art + fiction. Not all "related" materials will be assigned (most won't be), but many/most will be shared, distilled, and/or contextualized via lecture.    

Lectures and workshops will combine material from media history, science and technology studies, and technoculture studies with instruction in critical technical practice. There will be one lecture and one workshop each week, with group discussion at play in both. There will be 13 weeks of instruction. 

Order of prompts to be determined. More prompts to be added, too.  

**Use Markdown to Document Your Research**

Experiment with a text editor (from list provided) and use it to document and share your research and learning this term. Think about where documentation goes, who sees it, for whom it's written, and under what assumptions about design, development, and community.

Related art and fiction: Shelley, *Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus*; Jackson, *my body — a Wunderkammer*

**Use Metadata to Attribute Unattributed Labour** 

Research an old technology (from list provided) and provide metadata (probably Dublin Core) for it. Include a list of who contributed to the technology, from ideation and design to development, maintenance, and sunsetting. Think about how labour escapes and is also elided from records, as well as how it's shaped by metadata fields/labels.

Related art and fiction: Moore, "No Woman Born"; Bosanquet, *Henry James at Work*  

**Use Pen + Paper to Learn Some Unix Commands**

Paper prototype a few Unix commands to get a sense of how they mediate our relationships with technologies and computation. Think about the relationship between the command line, interface, and control.

**Locate Local Network Infrastructures**

Use materials provided to study parts of Victoria and create brief tours of local network infrastructure. Think about the land you're on and its histories. Also think about "invisible technologies."

**Audit an Algorithm (Bug Bounty Optional)** 

Rate an algorithm (from list provided) and identify biases at play. Find a bug! Think about the relationships between algorithms, trust, and agency.

**Use an Algorithm to Create Something** 

Experiment with "capture" software (from a list provided) to create or stitch together something familiar yet unfamiliar. Think about the assumptions of proof and evidence at play in computer vision and capture technologies (e.g., photography and phonography).

**Use Browser Dev Tools to Engage Assistive Tech** 

Identify a website (from list provided) and use a browser development tool and/or WAVE to assess the site's engagement with assistive technologies. Think about how all technologies are assistive and how audiences are addressed through web design and dev.  

Corresponding myths: *Technology as Extension and/or Cure*

**Use a Text Editor to Open and Bend a File**

Select some historical media (from list provided), open it in a text editor, and "bend" or "glitch" it. Save the results. Talk with UVic librarians (according to schedule provided) about their digital scholarship and media archaeology initiatives. Think about how maintenance and formats play a role in digital preservation.

**Make a Zine about Technoculture**

Alone or in small groups (2-3 people), make a zine about a technocutlural issue important to you. Feel free to be a fan. But also think about the zine as a space of creative + critical expression, with an element of pedagogy. You can teach people about something. Visit Special Collections (according to schedule provided) to get a sense of zine history, politics, and aesthetics. We'll hold a zine fest at the end of term. Your zine should be tactile, but may of course involve digital means.    

Corresponding myths: *Screen Essentialism* and *Binary*
