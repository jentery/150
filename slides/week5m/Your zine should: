# Unlearning the Internet: The Zine (Final Project)

I'm asking you to make a zine in this course. It's due by April 4th. 

Your zine should: 

* Be between 8 and 20 pages.
* Be made with paper, using only manual or a combination of manual and automated techniques. The binding may be stitched, stapled, taped, or folded. 
* Include handwritten or typed text as well as hand-drawn or printed images. If the text or images are not yours, then the dealing must be fair, with attribution. 
* Have a title, with attribution (your name as you'd like it to appear), date, location (optional), url (optional), and license.  
* Be issue #4 of your zine. (That is, compose as if the first three issues already exist. This way, you don't need to introduce and frame the zine for your audience.)
* Be aware of its community (or intended audience) and create a personal connection with them. 
* Include no advertisements. 
* May encourage contributions from readers (e.g., spaces for them to write in the zine).
* Engage directly an issue we've studied this semester. (Consider reviewing the section headings for each week.)
* Address something relevant to that issue that has not happened, or something that's neither possible nor impossible (see Joanna Russ). This may be something you wish *would* happen.
* Instruct your intended audience in how to perform a certain task or approach a specific problem relevant to that issue.
