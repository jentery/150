    <h1>Important Considerations</h1>
    <h3>"Firsts" are important<br>
        But "firsts" can be difficult to determine<br>
        And "firsts" tend to motivate a lot of clickbait<br>
        Gender is not binary<br>
        Labour is difficult to trace and historicize</h3>

    <h1>Ada Augusta,<br>Countess of Lovelace</h1>
    <h3>articulated core elements of computer languages and<br>fundamental concepts of computer programming<br>but her work was practically ignored for ~100 years</h3>
    <p>"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. Its province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted with. This it is calculated to effect primarily and chiefly of course, through its executive faculties; but it is likely to exert an indirect and reciprocal influence on science itself in another manner. For, in so distributing and combining the truths and the formulæ of analysis, that they may become most easily and rapidly amenable to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relations and the nature of many subjects in that science are necessarily thrown into new lights, and more profoundly investigated." (published note "G," October 1842)</p>

    <h1>Navajo Contributions to<br>Circuit Manufacturing</h1>
    <h3>absent from official histories of Silicon Valley<br>protestors from American Indian Movement helped to<br>shut down the plant in 1975 due to poor labour conditions</h3>
    <p>"I learned that from 1965-1975 the Fairchild Corporation’s Semiconductor Division operated a large integrated circuit manufacturing plant in Shiprock, New Mexico, on a Navajo reservation. During this time the corporation was the largest private employer of Indian workers in the U.S. The circuits that the almost entirely female Navajo workers produced were used in devices such as calculators, missile guidance systems, and other early computing devices."
